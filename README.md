## Hey

My name is GonÃ§alo Amaro and Iâ€™m a web developer with a unique professional journey that bridges **journalism** and **technology**. After a decade covering financial markets as an economic journalist, where I sharpened my skills in data analysis, investigation, and storytelling, I decided to embrace a new challenge and transition into software development.

In early 2025, I started a Full-stack Development certification at Udemy, from The App Brewery (London), building prototypes, some of which even grew into MVPs. Iâ€™ve worked on frontend projectsâ€”creating intuitive interfaces, UI/UX, animations, and performance optimization with **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, jQuery, and React**, as well as backend development with **Node.js/Express, PostgreSQL, and REST APIs**, with a strong emphasis on security and scalability.

I also have hands-on experience in conversational AI, designing intelligent workflows, training agents, and integrating frameworks like Botpress and Chatbase into enterprise solutions. Still learning and always will be.
