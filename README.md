## Hey

My name is Gonçalo Amaro and I’m a web developer with a unique professional journey that bridges **journalism** and **technology**. After a decade covering financial markets as an economic journalist, where I sharpened my skills in data analysis, investigation, and storytelling, I decided to embrace a new challenge and transition into software development. Check my work below or [here](https://samarog.github.io/devcard/).

<p>
  In early 2025, I started a <strong>Full-stack Development certification</strong> at Udemy, from 
  <em>The App Brewery (London)</em>, building prototypes, some of which even grew into MVPs.
</p>

<p>
  I’ve worked on <strong>frontend projects</strong>, creating intuitive interfaces, UI/UX, animations, 
  and performance optimization with <strong>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, jQuery, and React</strong>, 
  as well as <strong>backend development</strong> with <strong>Node.js/Express, PostgreSQL, and REST APIs</strong>, 
  with a strong emphasis on security and scalability.
</p>

<p>
  I also have hands-on experience in <strong>conversational AI</strong>, designing intelligent workflows, 
  training agents, and integrating frameworks like <strong>Botpress</strong> and <strong>Chatbase</strong> 
  into enterprise solutions.
</p>

<p>
  <em>Still learning and will always be.</em>
